# Project-5-CSS-to-Sass
----
This is my fifth project for Treehouse Techdegree: Front End Developer.

**Project Notes:**
* Attempted to hit all exceeds criteria
* In the future, I'm going to implement this type of feature via CSS, although this time I used JS/jQuery. I had a lot of difficulty with window.innerWidth behaving consistently across browsers, and trying to get it to fire in conjunction with the CSS media queries.
	* Safari appears to be impacted by different crollbar display settings in the Finder that changed the window.innerWidth measurements
* I can see the benefits of moving a CSS project to Sass but had difficulty "thinking" in a partials/Sass way. I'm not sure I could write a project as partials from the start at this point.
* Extends apparently can't be used in media queries but I was able to implement a mixin instead

**Needs Work or Need to Learn:**
* This was a fairly straightforward project but had some trouble getting the command line going at first. A basic primer on things like changing directories in Terminal would be helpful for those of us who are new to the command line.
* Nesting makes sense to me for pseudoselectors but not for much else? I need to read more about any benefits of nesting as they weren't immediately apparent to me other than being "organized".
* Mixins appear very powerful and I haven't really scratched the surface of what they can do as far as passing arguments.
* I need to read a tutorial on writing a project in Sass from the start instead of converting one to see workflow differences. In line media queries, for example, seem great to refactor, but more confusing to code from scratch?

~Time to complete: 7 days probably total, the scripting for the menu and resolving innerWidth bug took longer than actually converting anything to Sass.
